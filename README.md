# edward-dev-workflow

An AI-driven development workflow plugin for Claude Code. It orchestrates the full development lifecycle through a multi-stage gate system — from brainstorming and planning, through implementation and review, to finalization — using specialized agents that enforce quality at every transition.

> **Best used with [Superpowers](https://github.com/grp-bork/superpowers).** This plugin is designed to run alongside the Superpowers plugin. Superpowers provides the foundational skill invocation system that this plugin's agents rely on — without it, you lose the automatic skill routing, parallel agent dispatch, and discipline enforcement that make the workflow effective. Install both to get the full development governance experience.
>
> For a detailed walkthrough of the development pipeline — stages, gates, agent routing, and transition rules — refer to [`skills/references/workflow.md`](skills/references/workflow.md).

## What It Does

- **Orchestrates every stage** of development: PLANNING → DEVELOPING → REVIEW → FINALIZED
- **Enforces quality gates** — no code before a plan, no merge before review passes
- **Routes to domain specialists** for data engineering, analytics, data science, and database work
- **Supports parallel agent dispatch** for independent tasks
- **Provides discipline skills** for TDD, debugging, code review, and git worktrees

## Installation

> **Prerequisite:** Install the [Superpowers plugin](https://github.com/grp-bork/superpowers) first. It provides the skill invocation layer this plugin depends on.

### Option A — Via Claude Code (recommended)

Run these two commands inside Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add edwardkao6413/edward-dev-workflow
/plugin install edward-dev-workflow@edward-dev-workflow
```

The first command registers this repo as a plugin source. The second installs the plugin.

### Option B — Local (Git Clone)

1. Clone this repo:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/edwardkao6413/edward-dev-workflow.git
   ```
2. In Claude Code, run:
   ```
   /plugin marketplace add /path/to/edward-workflow
   /plugin install edward-dev-workflow@edward-dev-workflow
   ```

## Getting Started

Once installed, start any new project with:

```
/edward-dev-workflow:init-project
```

This scaffolds the full governance structure (`.dev-manager/`, `project.config.md`, `state.json`) into your project and hands control to `dev-manager` to begin work.
