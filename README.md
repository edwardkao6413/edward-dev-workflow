# edward-dev-workflow

An AI-driven development workflow plugin for Claude Code. It orchestrates the full development lifecycle through a multi-stage gate system — from brainstorming and planning, through implementation and review, to finalization — using specialized agents that enforce quality at every transition.

---

## What It Does

- **Orchestrates every stage** of development: PLANNING → DEVELOPING → REVIEW → FINALIZED
- **Enforces quality gates** — no code before a plan, no merge before review passes
- **Routes to domain specialists** for data engineering, analytics, data science, and database work
- **Supports parallel agent dispatch** for independent tasks
- **Provides discipline skills** for TDD, debugging, code review, and git worktrees

## Installation

### Option A — Superpowers Marketplace

Search for `edward-dev-workflow` in the Superpowers marketplace and install directly.

### Option B — Manual (Git Clone)

1. Clone this repo:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/edwardkao6413/edward-workflow.git
   ```
2. In Claude Code, open Settings → Plugins → Add Local Plugin
3. Point it at the cloned directory

## Getting Started

Once installed, start any new project with:

```
/init-project
```

This scaffolds the full governance structure (`.dev-manager/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `state.json`) into your project and hands control to `dev-manager` to begin work.
